    "**The different panes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text editor: Central middle pane where you will write your scripts and be able to save your files\n",
    "- Projects pane: Left pane which shows all the files in your project you can double click to open them\n",
    "- Variable Explorer: Upper right pane where your objects/variables will appear (may need to press refresh). Also where help, plots and other tabs are avaiable.\n",
    "- Python console: Bottom right pane where you can run python code. Code written here will not be saved.\n",

    "You can move panes around or re-size them. I will stick to the defaults, so we are all looking at a similar format. You can also change the color pallete of Spyder. By default we are in a dark mode, but we can choose something lighter. To do this go to Tools -> Prefrences \n",

However, you can also use Jupyter Notebooks in JupterLab, a web-based environment. More information on JupyterLab here:  https://jupyter.org/.

    "1. Code Generation Assistance: Helps generate code snippets based on natural language descriptions.\n",
    "2. Learning and Exploration: Assists in exploring programming concepts and provides explanations.\n",
    "3. Algorithm Design: Aids in discussing and refining high-level algorithmic approaches.\n",
    "4. Language Syntax Help: Provides assistance with language syntax and code structuring.\n",
    "5. Debugging Guidance: Offers insights into potential code issues and suggests debugging strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lack of Context Awareness: May not fully understand the context of a programming project.\n",
    "2. Limited Domain-Specific Knowledge: Might lack awareness of the latest tools and libraries.\n",
    "3. Security Concerns: Avoid sharing sensitive information to prevent unintentional code vulnerabilities.\n",
    "4. Not a Substitute for Learning: Shouldn't replace active learning; understanding concepts is crucial.\n",
    "5. Potential for Incorrect Code: Generated code may be syntactically correct but logically flawed.\n",
    "6. Misinterpretation of Queries: Ambiguous queries can lead to unintended responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using ChatGPT for programming tasks can be beneficial for certain aspects, but users should approach it with a cautious and discerning mindset. It's most effective when used as a supplementary tool alongside other learning resources and a hands-on coding environment."
