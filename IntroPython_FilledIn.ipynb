    "A few things before getting started. We are currently working in Spyder, a popular IDE for writing python code. This is one option for creating and editing Python files, but there are many other options such as PyCharm or VS Code. \n",

    "## Spyder IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "**The different panes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text editor: Central middle pane where you will write your scripts and be able to save your files\n",
    "- Projects pane: Left pane which shows all the files in your project you can double click to open them\n",
    "- Variable Explorer: Upper right pane where your objects/variables will appear (may need to press refresh). Also where help, plots and other tabs are avaiable.\n",
    "- Python console: Bottom right pane where you can run python code. Code written here will not be saved.\n",
    "\n",

    "More information: https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/editor.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changing the appearance**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can move panes around or re-size them. I will stick to the defaults, so we are all looking at a similar format. You can also change the color pallete of Spyder. By default we are in a dark mode, but we can choose something lighter. To do this go to Tools -> Prefrences \n",

    "## Spyder projects\n",
    "\n",
    "You can associate a directory (folder) with a **Project** that will group your files together and keeps track of which files you had open in the editor previously. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, your projectâ€™s root folder is used to set your working directory, and automatically added to the PYTHONPATH, so you can easily import and work with any modules and packages you create inside of it.\n",

We're working with this Notebook locally through `Spyder-Notebook` which we installed with the following command conda install spyder-notebook -c conda-forge. However, you can also use Jupyter Notebooks in JupterLab, a web-based environment. More informaion on JupyterLab here:  https://jupyter.org/. If you were unable to install `Spyder-Notebook`, there are instructions below on how to open the file in JupyterLab.\n",

    "**Establishing a console**\n",

    "#### Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Code Generation Assistance: Helps generate code snippets based on natural language descriptions.\n",
    "2. Learning and Exploration: Assists in exploring programming concepts and provides explanations.\n",
    "3. Algorithm Design: Aids in discussing and refining high-level algorithmic approaches.\n",
    "4. Language Syntax Help: Provides assistance with language syntax and code structuring.\n",
    "5. Debugging Guidance: Offers insights into potential code issues and suggests debugging strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lack of Context Awareness: May not fully understand the context of a programming project.\n",
    "2. Limited Domain-Specific Knowledge: Might lack awareness of the latest tools and libraries.\n",
    "3. Security Concerns: Avoid sharing sensitive information to prevent unintentional code vulnerabilities.\n",
    "4. Not a Substitute for Learning: Shouldn't replace active learning; understanding concepts is crucial.\n",
    "5. Potential for Incorrect Code: Generated code may be syntactically correct but logically flawed.\n",
    "6. Misinterpretation of Queries: Ambiguous queries can lead to unintended responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using ChatGPT for programming tasks can be beneficial for certain aspects, but users should approach it with a cautious and discerning mindset. It's most effective when used as a supplementary tool alongside other learning resources and a hands-on coding environment."
